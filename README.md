# Usage

**WARNING**: BEFORE OPEN IDA your must set env var: _NT_SYMBOL_PATH to windows symbols, ex: 
```
SRV*C:\winsymbols*
```` 

1. Open IDA PRO, start a debug session (go to Debugger -> Attach -> Remote GDB debugger)
2. File -> Script File -> ida_bochs_windows.py

Done!

# Some possible problems

```
The crash is in ulm.c

Without more details, part of it means that I'm guessing here, but there's a very high probability that it stands for "User Level Monitor" as it does elsewhere whenever VMware mentions "ulm".

As such that means your VM is running on a host with Hyper-V mode enabled.

That codepath is pretty new and is most likely why you are getting this issue.
The most likely workaround would be to disable Hyper-V mode at the host level.
This might not be an option for you though.

If it is then the steps to disable the Hyper-V role is to run the following command at the host in windows command-line with Administrator privileges:

bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
Reboot the system to activate it.

If you want to go back to Hyper-V mode again, then you can enable it like this:

bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
 

hope this helps,
```
